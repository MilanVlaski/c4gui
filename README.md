### Glossary
- [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/introduction) - represents software systems in 4 views: system Context, Container, Component, Code.
- [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) - a project that allows drawing C4 models with a DSL, as well as exporting between formats like the ones used by PlantUML or Mermaid.
## High level plan
- [x] Do a little model with Structurizr to familiarize with the usage
	- [x] Modelling
	- [ ] Understand how custom Structurizr styling works.
- [ ] C4 modelling webapp
	- [ ] Demo 1 - can draw some elements, but never export or share.
	- [ ] Demo 2 - can draw some diagrams as well as share with magic link. Demo 1 + backend with storage
	- [ ] Demo 3 - can draw diagrams, import export PlantUML, and share via magic link + Demo 2 + export logic, using Structurizr libraries.
