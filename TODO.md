### To do
- [x] When an element pressed is being pressed, ie being connected to another element, draw a simple dotted line from the element to the pointer
	- [x] Either do this with leaderline and a Draggable invisible element
	- [x] Or with a primitive dotted line
	- [x] Should be visible while in "ConnectingState"
- [ ] Create a person, shaped with CSS.
	- [ ] Add button to add a user
- [ ] Stop drawing temp arrow while pointer is inside the element 
- [ ] Connect person with software system
- [x] Connect two software systems
    - [x] Go into connecting state on pointerdown
- [x] Have a leaderline between mouse pointer and the object that was clicked. Good for UX, but don't know how to do.
