### To do
- [x] Put structurizr example on this laptop
- [x] See what types of elements there are at the "context" level
- [ ] Display a header signifying that this is the System Context view
- [ ] Hover over arrow and enable adding text on top of it
- [ ] Draggable elements
- [x] When an element pressed is being pressed, ie being connected to another element, draw a simple dotted line from the element to the pointer
	- [x] Either do this with leaderline and a Draggable invisible element
	- [x] Or with a primitive dotted line
	- [x] Should be visible while in "ConnectingState"
- [x] Create a person, shaped with CSS.
	- [x]Add button to add a user
- [ ] Stop drawing temp arrow while pointer is inside the element 
- [x] Connect person with software system
- [x] Connect two software systems
    - [x] Go into connecting state on pointerdown
- [x] Have a leaderline between mouse pointer and the object that was clicked. Good for UX, but don't know how to do.
