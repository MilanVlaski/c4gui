### To do
- [ ] Refactor functions.
- [ ] On single click, instead of displaying the input, display a form on top of the diagram element.
	- Form should have an OK and cancel
	- Form should go away once we click away, like the input does. Can be done with blur event?
	- Optional. Form should go to the left or right if there is space.
- [ ] Double click on a software system leads to a zoom in to container view.
	- Given I have placed a software system in the system context view
	- When I double click on the software system
	- [x] Then the canvas will be cleared
	- [x] And the buttons will be replaced with a Container button, Software System button and Person button
	- [ ] And the heading will display the display name of the software system
	- [ ] When I click the back arrow on the top left of the canvas
	- [ ] The canvas will have the element at the position it was left at
	- [ ]
- [ ] Add database button to container view
	- [ ] Just redraw the elements, memorizing their positions for this purpose.
	-  Double clicking a Container means the canvas is cleared, and loaded with the container contents, with the name of the Container, and appropriate buttons, etc.
	- The page will be loaded dynamically, because that's much faster.
- [ ] Have a fixed thing at the top which has a "Pan" button, to move the canvas around.
- [ ] Hover over relationship arrow and enable adding text on top of it
	- Tough. Maybe try from the sidebar instead.
- [ ] Centered toolbar
	- [ ] Arranging state (Draggable etc?).
		- [ ] Mouse becomes drag.
	- [ ] Panning state
#### Model
- [ ] Tree on the left with currently existing elements
	- [ ] Drag and drop elements. Important, to promote reuse.
	- [ ] Delete an element.
- [ ] Right click delete an element.
#### GUI Improvements Graveyard
- [ ] Copy styling of structurizr (use a ruler to find out proportions)
- [ ] On hover attributes are important, because most people draw diagrams on a PC.
- [ ] After watching CSS tutorial, make your own styling.
- [ ] Make relationship straight, dotted, and thin.
- [ ] Cursor changes when button to add an element is clicked
- [ ] Connecting doesn't work on mobile. Events don't propagate correctly.
	- [ ] Fix the mobile connecting problem by having the same handler for both mouse and touch.
#### Solved
- [x] ContentEditable default behavior sucks. Come up with a better solution. Solved by doing an input.
- [x] Add elements to an in memory model
	- [x] Enforce name uniqueness by taking the name of the element, and adding a number.
		- [x] Number should be counted, probably by the "model"
		- [x] Each HTML element should have same id as model name 
	- [x] Prevent duplicates. Elements should have unique names.
- [x] Editing the ~~contentEditable~~ displayName of an element should propagate to the model, and a rename should be attempted.
- [x] Prevent duplicate relationships
	- [x] First, store relationships
	- [x] They should belong to a systemContext, for now, because that's important for later segregation
	- [x] A relationship is therefore unique in a system context, the key being the two elements connected
- [x] Don't draw leaderline while pointer is down over the pointered down element.
- [x] Put structurizr example on this laptop
- [x] See what types of elements there are at the "context" level
- [x] Display a header signifying that this is the System Context view
- [x] When an element pressed is being pressed, ie being connected to another element, draw a simple dotted line from the element to the pointer
	- [x] Either do this with leaderline and a Draggable invisible element
	- [x] Or with a primitive dotted line
	- [x] Should be visible while in "ConnectingState"
- [x] Create a person, shaped with CSS.
	- [x]Add button to add a user
- [ ] Stop drawing temp arrow while pointer is inside the element 
- [x] Connect person with software system
- [x] Connect two software systems
    - [x] Go into connecting state on pointerdown
- [x] Have a leaderline between mouse pointer and the object that was clicked. Good for UX, but don't know how to do.
